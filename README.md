> A template for typescript nodejs projects with configuration files such as
> tsconfig & eslint.

## ESLint

Extends the airbnb javascript styleguide adding also typescript support.
Generated with `npx eslint --init`

## tsconfig.json

This tsconfig.json comes from
[Ben awad recommended tsconfig](https://github.com/benawad/tsconfig.json) Thanks
Ben <3

## Jest

jest.json configured to handle *.test.ts files under the tests & src folders.
Also we use ts-jest to run our tests without compiling typescript to javascript

## package.json

I use ts-node-dev to run my code on development mode as it is super fast (sorry
nodemon I don't need you anymore)

## Prettier

I don't think I need prettier as this ESLint config works totally fine for me.
If you want to make a pull request adding ESLint prettier config you are welcome

## .gitignore

.gitignore generated with gitignore.io, works fine without any further change :D

## Github action

I've just added the default nodejs github workflow as it works perfectly fine
for simple nodejs projects (Just install dependencies, build & test)
